# TASK_6-Password-Evaluation

# Password Strength Evaluation Report

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and evaluate its strength using online tools.

---

## Tools Used
- Online password strength checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com)
- Manual analysis for complexity and best practices
- Python script to automate report generation

---

## Steps Performed

### 1. Created Multiple Passwords
A total of 9 passwords were created with varying levels of complexity:
- Simple passwords with only lowercase
- Mixed-case passwords
- Passwords with numbers and symbols
- Very strong passwords using all character types

### 2. Password Examples
Examples include:
- `password` (simple, lowercase only)
- `Password123!` (medium complexity)
- `Str0ngP@ssw0rd!2025#` (high complexity)

### 3. Tested Passwords
Each password was tested using an online password strength checker.

### 4. Evaluated Scores and Feedback
Scores (out of 100) and qualitative feedback were documented for each password:
- Simple passwords scored below 50
- Medium complexity scored between 50â€“80
- High complexity passwords scored 90+

### 5. Summarized Best Practices
Learned best practices for creating strong passwords:
- Use a mix of character types
- Make them long (12+ characters)
- Avoid dictionary words or patterns
- Never reuse passwords
- Use a password manager

### 6. Studied Common Password Attacks
Included a summary of the most common attack methods:
- Brute force
- Dictionary attacks
- Credential stuffing
- Keylogging
- Phishing

### 7. Analyzed Impact of Complexity
More complex passwords were significantly more secure and resistant to attack methods, especially brute force and dictionary attacks.
