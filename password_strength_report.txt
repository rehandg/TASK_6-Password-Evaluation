Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords:
1. Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.
2. Include numbers and special characters (!, @, #, etc.).
3. Make passwords at least 12 characters long.
4. Avoid common words, names, or sequential patterns.
5. Use passphrases or randomly generated strings.
6. Donâ€™t reuse passwords across different accounts.
7. Use a password manager to store and generate complex passwords.


Common Password Attacks:
1. Brute Force: Trying all combinations until the correct one is found.
2. Dictionary Attack: Using a list of common passwords or words.
3. Phishing: Tricking users into revealing passwords via fake sites/emails.
4. Keylogging: Recording keystrokes to capture passwords.
5. Credential Stuffing: Using leaked passwords from one service to access others.

Effect of Password Complexity:
- Complex passwords significantly reduce the success of brute-force and dictionary attacks.
- Longer passwords exponentially increase time required for cracking.
